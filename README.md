## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I enjoy creating new things. I have extensive experience in fine-tuning, optimizing, tailoring, and deploying LLMs for businesses to produce real value, as well as creating multi-agents RAG systems to help automate tasks.

I have deep knowledge of common neural networks architectures and the ability to recreate them from scratch, along with curiosity and a great desire to research and develop new, non-trivial AI solutions
